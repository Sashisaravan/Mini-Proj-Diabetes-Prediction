# Mini-Proj-Diabetes-Prediction

Diabetes is often called a modern-society disease because lack of regular exercise
and rising obesity rates are some of the main contributing factors for it and as per
global health statistics. Machine learning is used to predict diabetes. Machine learning
has several classification techniques which analyze the diabetes data and can help in
the early prediction of this disease. The dataset is taken from Kaggle. The dataset is
preprocessed, the outliers are rejected, feature selections are done and the missing
values are filled. There are 768 female diabetic patients, 268 diabetic patients, and
500 non-diabetic patients in the dataset. The machine learning algorithms used for
early prediction of diabetes are ANN (Artificial Neural networks), SVM (Support Vector
Machine), RF(Random Forest), KNN(K Nearest Neighbours), LR(Logistic Regression),
and NB (Na√Øve Bayes) From a comparative analysis of these methods it is observed
that SVM and LR provide 75% - 76% of accuracy, whereas ANN( Artificial Neutral
Network) provides 86% - 90% of accuracy.
